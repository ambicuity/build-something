# Build Something - Master the Fundamentals

Welcome to **Build Something**, a comprehensive collection of hands-on tutorials where you'll recreate popular tools and systems from scratch. Each project is designed to teach you fundamental programming concepts while building real, working software.

## 🎯 Philosophy

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." - Richard Feynman

This repository follows the principle of learning by building. Instead of just reading about how systems work, you'll implement them yourself using only basic programming constructs and standard libraries. No external dependencies, no magic frameworks - just pure understanding.

## 📚 Available Projects

### 🔧 System Tools
- **[Build Your Own Git](./git/)** - Version control system with basic branching and merging
- **[Build Your Own Shell](./shell/)** - Command-line interpreter with pipes and redirections
- **[Build Your Own Text Editor](./editor/)** - Terminal-based text editor with syntax highlighting

### 🌐 Network & Web
- **[Build Your Own HTTP Server](./http-server/)** - Web server with routing and static file serving
- **[Build Your Own Web Framework](./web-framework/)** - Lightweight framework with templating and middleware

### 💾 Data & Storage
- **[Build Your Own Database](./database/)** - Relational database with SQL parsing and B-tree indexing
- **[Build Your Own Key-Value Store](./kv-store/)** - Redis-like in-memory data structure server

### ⚡ Languages & Compilers
- **[Build Your Own Interpreter](./interpreter/)** - Language interpreter with lexer, parser, and evaluator
- **[Build Your Own Compiler](./compiler/)** - Simple compiler targeting assembly or bytecode

### 🔄 Distributed Systems
- **[Build Your Own Load Balancer](./load-balancer/)** - HTTP load balancer with health checking
- **[Build Your Own Message Queue](./message-queue/)** - Pub/sub messaging system

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose a Project**: Pick any project that interests you from the list above
2. **Read the Guide**: Each project has a detailed README with step-by-step instructions  
3. **Start Building**: Follow along with the tutorial, implementing features incrementally
4. **Test as You Go**: Each step includes tests to verify your implementation
5. **Extend and Explore**: Add your own features once you've mastered the basics

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

Each project directory contains:
- `README.md` - Complete tutorial with theory and implementation steps
- `starter/` - Basic project structure to get you started
- `examples/` - Reference implementations and test cases
- `tests/` - Automated tests to verify your implementation
- `docs/` - Additional resources and deep-dive explanations

## 🎓 Learning Path Recommendations

**Beginner**: Start with Shell → Text Editor → HTTP Server
**Intermediate**: Try Database → Interpreter → Web Framework  
**Advanced**: Tackle Compiler → Load Balancer → Message Queue

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in your chosen language (examples provided in Python, Go, and C)
- Understanding of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables)
- Familiarity with command-line tools and basic system concepts
