# Build Something - Master the Fundamentals

Welcome to **Build Something**, a comprehensive collection of hands-on tutorials where you'll recreate popular tools and systems from scratch. Each project is designed to teach you fundamental programming concepts while building real, working software.

## 🎯 Philosophy

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." - Richard Feynman

This repository follows the principle of learning by building. Instead of just reading about how systems work, you'll implement them yourself using only basic programming constructs and standard libraries. No external dependencies, no magic frameworks - just pure understanding.
